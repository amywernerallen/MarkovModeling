### Markov Modeling

As part of a research and development group at Arcadia, I collaborated with a coworker to develop a **Markov model** for analyzing state transitions for patients diagnosed with diabetes. We carefully mapped out the various **disease states** for diabetes, with help from the clinical team, and wrote SQL and R scripts to aggregate and analyze the data.

Our work was featured at [HIMSS](http://www.himssconference.org/about/general-info/about-conference) 2015, and is highlighted in this [Arcadia blog post](http://www.arcadiasolutions.com/closer-look-evolution-diabetes/).

Also included above is a company-wide presentation that we gave on predictive modeling, after our project was completed.
